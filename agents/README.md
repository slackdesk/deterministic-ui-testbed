# Agents

This folder contains version-controlled OpenClaw agent definitions.

Agents are deterministic AI workflows used to:

- generate Playwright tests
- run smoke validations
- analyze failures
- enforce selector strategy

These are not chat prompts.

They are reproducible, CI-safe behaviors with strict output contracts.
